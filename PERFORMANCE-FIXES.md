# Portfolio Website Performance Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Photo Loading Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Profile photo was not displaying correctly
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed image path using `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`
  - Added fallback image handling
  - Improved error handling with retry mechanism

### 2. Scroll Performance Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Website was hanging/stuttering during scroll
- **Solution**:
  - Added CSS performance optimizations (`will-change`, `backface-visibility`, `transform: translateZ(0)`)
  - Reduced blur effects from `blur-3xl` to `blur-2xl`
  - Optimized animations with `contain: layout style paint`
  - Added `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll optimization
  - Reduced animation complexity for better performance
